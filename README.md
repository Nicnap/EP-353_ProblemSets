# HelloWorld.c
when ran in the terminal prints the text "Hello, World!" when compiled and ran. The file is heavily ***commented*** meaning it has textual elements that don't change the arguments. There's a ***preprocessor*** that tells the compiler to pull from another source as well and a ***function,*** which has the argument inside of it. If you change the text inside of the printf("") double quotes, you can change what text prints on the terminal!
