#### What have you done for your project so far?

Created the basic framework for the noise generation and UI. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Attempted to run it! It's all in theory right now, which is how I usually code (kinda crazy I know) so nothing out of the ordinary.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

My own schedule and learning realtime DSP processing have been quite challenging.
