# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Wizard Wav

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a wavetable synthesizer.")

My project is about creating a synthesizer that a user can input integers into and get magical spell sounds.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

    My project will allow a user to input integers (tentatively 0-16) that will create complex sounds when combined. It should
    have 3 inputs to combine. It will be executed by running the application.

## If you are planning to combine EP-353's final project with another course's project, which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to EP-353, and which aspect(s) would connect to the other course?

N/A

## In the software world, almost everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And it is not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

My project will take three integer inputs and create a sound that sounds like magic.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

My project will have optional wave type selection.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

My project will take three integer inputs, use a cypher I create based off of what integers are input and when, and create a complex sound.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

For this, I will need to map out very closely what I want each sound to sound like. I will probably make some beginning sounds to base things off of to get a sense of the sound of the synth. Then, I will have to brush up on loop nesting for all of the potential variations. After that, it should mostly be implementation trial and error.
